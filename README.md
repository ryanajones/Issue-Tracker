# Issue Tracker

> Companies can use this web-based CRUD app as an internal tool for tracking issues on projects they might have. It is a REST API that utilizes node/express to make an HTTP server and handle requests from jQuery ajax calls. MongooseJS is used to communicate with mongoDB to create, read, update, and delete issues and projects. Function testing is done with the Chai/Mocha testing tools combination.
